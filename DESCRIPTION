Title: Feature Grouping and Sparse Principal Component Analysis (FGSPCA)
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) attempts to find sparse weight vectors (loadings), 
  i.e., a loading vector with only a few 'active' (nonzero) values. The SPCA approach provides better 
  interpretability for the principal components in high-dimensional data settings. Because 
  the principal components are formed as a linear combination of only a few of the original 
  variables. This package provides a modified sparse principal component analysis, 
  Feature Grouping and Sparse Principal Component Analysis (FGSPCA), which considers 
  additional structure information among loadings (feature grouping) as well as the sparsity 
  (feature selection) property among loadings.
